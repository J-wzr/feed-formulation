# feed-formulation
Description of the Feed fit rations formulae and the underlying code of the project still under development.
Problem statement.
1.	Poultry farming is one of the major incomes generating activities carried out by farmers in the world. In Uganda, a percentage of poultry farmers is about _ %. However, those able to access and afford quality feed mixtures required for good growth and development of poultry birds are very few. This is due to factors such as 
•	Lack of feed formulating knowledge.
•	Feed adulteration.
•	Unavailability of highly nutritious feeds.
•	Lack of access to poultry feed shops and feed mixing specialists.
Poultry feed being responsible for up to about 80% success of any poultry projects, this has led to losses and a lot of farmers being driven out of the poultry business and the existing feed formulation firms have highly exploited farmers.
All this is due to the inability of a poultry farmer to formulate highly nutritious poultry feed.
In some countries like Nigeria, the situation has worsened to an extent of farmers shooting birds because of lacking feeds.
Addressing this problem will improve on the performance of the poultry industry not only in Uganda but in other countries.
Existing Solution
Currently, some applications have been developed to help in feed formulation for example; “FeedMixer”, “Poultry Feed Formulation”, “Poultry Assistant”. However, the user interfaces of these applications do not help farmers effectively in solving the existing feed problem as;
•	They don’t give provision for farmers to use locally available feed sources. 
•	They need education elites with prior knowledge about feed formulation, leaving out farmers with low education levels.
•	Some of them have already formulated rations, leaving farmers with no choice since the feed sources can’t be changed.
•	The end-product is hard to interpret and put into use since it has units hard to interpret like percentages.
Our solution
An application with an easy-to-use interface and interpretable output enabling all categories of poultry farmers to use locally available and affordable feed mixing materials and integrate current market prices to come up with a least cost feed formular to make highly nutritious feeds.

2.	The UN-Goal worked on.
Goal: Zero hunger.
Target: To end all forms of hunger and malnutrition.
The current pressing need for poultry farmers to obtain the right nutritious feed mixtures and feed the community inspired us.
Implementation.
3.	We intend to design our solution using a mobile architecture; that is a Progressive Web Application that can be accessed and installed on all kinds of devices from the browser.
4.	We shall use Web / Progressive Web Apps, Android, Google analytics, as specific products and Google Cloud as a google platform. These will enable us to come up with our web application and host it on google cloud for easy accessibility by poultry farmers.
Feedback/ Testing/ Iteration.
5.	We assessed the poultry feed dealers and farmers about the need for implementing the feed formulation application in three different locations that is urban, peri-urban and rural areas and the need was high as in the video link below.
After the iteration, we realized that there was need to provide basic information on poultry management such as vaccination schedules, bird stocking rate and include the contacts of poultry feed dealers.
6.	One challenge faced was the integration of flutter framework for dart which would be most efficient in handling a bigger part of the back-end logic such as the solver function to carryout calculations in the background and output the result back to the poultry farmers. One way we handled this is by doing every part of the back-end logic with JavaScript since it would be fast for a well-organized Progressive Web Application.
Success and Completion of Solution.
7.	Our solution will easily enable farmers to come up with feed formulas using the real time market prices of locally available poultry feeds. Also, inputting the relevant information for poultry production and management will help to increase the participants in poultry production;
8.	Demo video: 

Scalability.
9.	In the future, the algorithm will be fed with information that allows it to formulate feed for other poultry species like ducks, turkeys, guinea fouls and for other livestock like dairy and beef cattle.
We shall reach a bigger audience through sub counties and extension workers who will lead us to the various farmer groups in their localities.
10.	Since this will be a progressive web application, it shall be downloadable by users in various locations as long as they can access internet.
